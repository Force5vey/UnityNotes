      it changes to 'verify' but also needs a cancel method. I think make the delete
      button wide enough so that after first click it 'splits' into two one for confirm
      and one for cancel.

      then
      completed is a separate toggle in the notes details.


      this allows for
      the follow: sort by completed, or exclude all completed

      delete selected.


      need
      to have a select all so when the filter is applied there can be easy batch
      operations.


      Additional notes: there is already a status of completed
      / abandoned. so the bool property of isCompleted should be more like something
      isArchived. Then they can stay in the notes collection and shown when specifically
      looked for.'

      So basically, the tags need to be the leading item

      this should be an option for the tag.


      something like: Leading only
      "//TODO" or Anywhere "public string ="TODO"

      leading only would skip
      anwhere, anywhere would have both. Then this can be for the standard comment
      style tags but also turned on so it can be for other code keywords or method
      calls, etc.'
